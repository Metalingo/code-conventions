# React

Code style documentations can often be described using `prettier` or `eslint` rules. But not all rules are perfect! This documentation describes the conventions on how we write code on Metalingo using React.

## Platform-Agnostic Approach

Although originally written for web, React is a multi-platform framework. This of course means that the rules/guidelines we suggest in this documentation are also platform agnostic.

Most of the rules are either related to component design(how you structure your components) and state management.
