## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are meant to be used as a way to:
1. Request others to review my code
2. Request others to confirm that my code can be merged into root branch

Most of the process requires some sort of review from another person. Since it's focused on giving feedback and improving the code quality, it is very important that the authorship of the code is clearly labeled(`git blame` should tell us) and that the pull request clarifies which changes are made as well as the specific areas in which the changes need reviews on.

### Making Reviews

A code review should be a concrete, suggestive comment on another author's pull request. With that said, here are the guidelines on how you should write a review:
* What kind of comment are you making? Is it a question? Is it a suggestion? Is it a possible bug?
* If you are pointing out a problem, are you also suggesting an alternative?
